# SmartScheduler_FinalYearProject
Hii there
      This is my final year project, we all know how we are being throught the pedamic of 2020- and still going on, no know how long it will be.  there are only two ways to 
      prevent the spread of corona virus. one is vaccination and another is avoiding crowdy places. we all are trying to  avoid step-out if it is not really  important  but
      what it is really important like buying vegetables,getting vaccine shot, hospitalising, visiting government offices, marriage hall or even temples we can't ask for an
      appointment about that. but assure me using this web application which is compatible with every device help you to get you appointment slot without human intervention
      so no one has to wait in the queues outside. and researchers says that most probably people are being infected in queues. so let's fight together and stop the  spread
      of tiny evil, all you need to sign-in and ask directly for the appointment slot, and we'll inform you via mail. thank you!
